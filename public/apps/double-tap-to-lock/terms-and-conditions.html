            <li>THE DEVELOPER: Özgür Görgülü</li>
            <li>THE APP: Double Tap To Lock (Double Tap To Lock (DTTL))</li>
        </ul>
    </fieldset>

    <p>By downloading or using THE APP, you automatically agree to these terms. Therefore, you should read them carefully before using THE APP. You are not allowed to copy or modify THE APP, any part of THE APP, or our trademarks in any way. You are not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of THE APP, and you should not try to translate THE APP into other languages or create derivative versions. THE APP itself, along with all the trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to THE DEVELOPER.</p>
    <p>THE DEVELOPER is committed to ensuring that THE APP is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to THE APP or charge for its services at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for THE APP or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you are paying for.</p>
    <p>THE APP stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us in order to provide its service. It is your responsibility to keep your phone and access to THE APP secure. Therefore, we recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Doing so could make your phone vulnerable to malware, viruses, or malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features, and potentially cause THE APP to not work properly or at all.</p>

    <h2>THE DEVELOPER's Responsibility</h2>
    <p>You should be aware that there are certain things for which THE DEVELOPER will not take responsibility. Certain functions of THE APP will require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. However, THE DEVELOPER cannot be held responsible if THE APP does not work at full functionality due to a lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have depleted your data allowance.</p>
    <p>If you are using THE APP outside an area with Wi-Fi, please remember that the terms of agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. Consequently, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data during the time you are connected to THE APP, or other third-party charges. By using THE APP, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use THE APP outside your home territory (for example, in a different region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using THE APP, please be aware that we assume you have received permission from the bill payer to use THE APP.</p>
    <p>Similarly, THE DEVELOPER cannot always take responsibility for how you use THE APP (for example, ensuring your device remains charged). If your device runs out of battery, and you are unable to turn it on to access the service, THE DEVELOPER cannot accept responsibility.</p>
    <p>Regarding THE DEVELOPER's responsibility for your use of THE APP, it's important to remember that while we strive to keep it updated and accurate at all times, we rely on third parties to provide information to us for making it available to you. THE DEVELOPER assumes no liability for any direct or indirect loss you may experience as a result of relying solely on this functionality of THE APP.</p>

    <h2>Updates to THE APP</h2>
    <p>At some point, we may decide to update THE APP. Currently, THE APP is available on Android, and the system requirements (as well as any additional systems to which we may extend THE APP's availability) may change. You will need to download the updates if you wish to continue using THE APP. THE DEVELOPER does not guarantee that it will always update THE APP to remain relevant to you or to be compatible with the version of Android installed on your device. However, you agree to accept updates to THE APP when they are offered.</p>
    <p>Additionally, we may choose to discontinue providing THE APP and can terminate its use at any time without prior notice to you. Unless otherwise specified, upon termination;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will cease.</li>
        <li>You must stop using THE APP and, if necessary, remove it from your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update our Terms and Conditions periodically. Therefore, we advise you to review this page regularly for any changes. These changes become effective immediately upon being posted on this page.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about these Terms and Conditions, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
